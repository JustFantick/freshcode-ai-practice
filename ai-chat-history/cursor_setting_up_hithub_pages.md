How does build works in my project? I dont get why when i run build and open @index.html i see an empty page

I'll help you understand how the build process works in your project and why you're seeing an empty page. Let me examine your project structure and build configuration.


Now let me check the main.tsx file to understand the entry point:


Now I understand the issue! Here's what's happening with your build process:

## How Your Build Works

1. **Build Command**: When you run `npm run build`, it executes:
   - `tsc -b` (TypeScript compilation)
   - `vite build` (Vite bundling)

2. **Output Directory**: Your `vite.config.ts` specifies `outDir: "docs"`, so the built files go to the `docs/` folder

3. **The Problem**: You're opening the wrong `index.html` file!

## The Issue

You have **two** `index.html` files:
- `/index.html` (source file) - This is for development
- `/docs/index.html` (built file) - This is for production

The built version in `docs/index.html` has the correct asset references:
```html
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/index-DdtNHMCt.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="/assets/index-CzwwPNCr.css">
```

But when you open it directly in a browser, the paths are wrong because:
- The browser looks for `/assets/index-DdtNHMCt.js` (absolute path)
- But the files are actually at `./assets/index-DdtNHMCt.js` (relative path)

## Solutions

**Option 1: Use the preview command (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run preview
```
This serves the built files correctly with proper path resolution.

**Option 2: Fix the base path in vite.config.ts**
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: "./", // Change from "/" to "./"
  build: {
    outDir: "docs",
  },
});
```

**Option 3: Serve the docs folder with a local server**
```bash
# Using Python
cd docs && python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve docs
```

The preview command is the best solution as it properly serves your built application with correct asset paths.

```html
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/index-DdtNHMCt.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="/assets/index-CzwwPNCr.css">
```

```shellscript
npm run preview
```

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: "./", // Change from "/" to "./"
  build: {
    outDir: "docs",
  },
});
```

```shellscript
# Using Python
cd docs && python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve docs
```

Ok i get it, but what i want to deply that website on GitHub Pages? Assume that want to deploy it at @docs/ folder

Perfect! For GitHub Pages deployment using the `docs/` folder, you need to fix the base path in your Vite configuration. Here's what you need to do:


```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: "/freshcode-ai-practice/",
  build: {
    outDir: "docs",
  },
});

```

Now rebuild your project and set up GitHub Pages:


Perfect! Now here's what you need to do to deploy to GitHub Pages:

## GitHub Pages Setup Steps

1. **Push your changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
   - Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
   - Select **main** branch and **/docs** folder
   - Click **Save**

3. **Your site will be available at:**
   ```
   https://yourusername.github.io/freshcode-ai-practice/
   ```

## What I Changed

I updated your `vite.config.ts` to set `base: "/freshcode-ai-practice/"` which tells Vite to:
- Generate asset paths relative to your repository name
- Ensure all CSS and JS files load correctly from the GitHub Pages URL
- Make the app work when served from `https://yourusername.github.io/freshcode-ai-practice/`

The build completed successfully and generated the correct files in the `docs/` folder with the proper base path. Your Todo app should now work perfectly on GitHub Pages!

```shellscript
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
```
